Dungeon Fight architectural notes

Game sequence alternates between world and combat modes. In explore and combat
modes. In explore mode, the user inputs movement commands and, where enemies
are present, can opt to attack them. (Party management is to be completely
ignored for the moment.) In combat mode, the player inputs a command for each
party member, and then party and enemy actions are resolved at once.

The most obvious way to handle the two modes is for each to implement a loop,
with a top-level control context which notices when combat has ended and hands
control back to the explore loop. In fact, the entire combat loop can probably
exist within a single combat(party, enemy) command or something.

So we can have an ExploreMode which loads a map and places the user into it,
and maintains any other information necessary. CombatMode handles the combat
loop. Game would be the top level, for now, and is mostly responsible for
setting up ExploreMode.
